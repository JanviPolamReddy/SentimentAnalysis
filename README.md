# Sentiment Analysis Project: Fine-tuning BERT for Amazon Reviews

## Overview
This project involves fine-tuning a pretrained BERT model for sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews. The goal is to classify reviews into one of five sentiment ratings: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, thereby understanding customer opinions and sentiments towards various products.

## Objectives
- To leverage BERT embeddings for representing text data.
- To train a classifier on these embeddings for sentiment analysis.
- To evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Split the dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% test set.
2. **Embedding Representation**: Use BERT embeddings to represent each review.
3. **Classifier Training**: Train a classifier on the BERT embeddings extracted from the training set.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained classifier on the test set to assess its accuracy and generalizability.

## Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers library (for BERT)

## Key Findings
The fine-tuned BERT model achieved high accuracy in classifying Amazon product reviews into the five sentiment ratings. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of BERT in capturing nuanced semantic meanings for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Future Work
- Explore the use of other pretrained models (e.g., GPT) for comparison.
- Investigate techniques for improving model performance, such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods.
